          I am a young web developer with multiple years learning about graphic design, web development, and 3D design. Currently Iâ€™m studying Software Engineering at my local community college (CLC). I love to create interactive works of art that utilize all points of my imagination. I take pride in my creative endeavors; starting a YouTube channel young, diving in on my own into the fast-paced world of web development, and creating memorable works of art.

            After spending the last 6 months or so learning Blender and how much it has to offer as a tool for web developers, I am now focusing on creating full-stack applications running in a production environment. 
This current product you are currently using is a Recipe App that allows users to login and create recipes with their accounts hosted from my back-end. It utilizes the most recent version of NextJS and the latest version of React to make it much easier to focus on delivering a smooth and unique user-experience.

            My passion is working in a fast-paced enviorment within the world of tech. I am working as a cook at a local restaurant while going to school full-time. For my free time I like to create websites that test my creativity and entice my imagination. 
            <br />
            <br /> 
            
            Going on I will look to gain my first client by making a website for the restaurant I work at. More importantly I am looking to intern somewhere to showcase my compelling work-ethic and technical skills. Hopefully I can get offered to work someplace I can stay or meet some good connections.

            Something else about me is I am a dual-citzien of The United States and Germany and am willing to relocate for an oppurtunity.
